/*
    Delete all the nodes from the list that are greater than x

    https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/delete-nodes-list-greater-x/

    Input : list: 7->3->4->8->5->1
            x = 6
    Output : 3->4->5->1


    This is a very simple algorithm.

    IMPORTANT:Important thing to remember is that you need to keep pointers of prev and next nodes also whenever you need to delete/add the node from the list.
