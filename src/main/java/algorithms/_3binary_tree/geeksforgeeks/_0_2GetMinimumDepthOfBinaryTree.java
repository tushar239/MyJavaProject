    Find Minimum Depth of a Binary Tree

    https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-minimum-depth-of-a-binary-tree/

    This algorithm is based on 'GetHeightOfBinaryTree.java'.

    Get height of left subtree
    Get height of right subtree
    whichever is smaller(instead of bigger), add 1 to that to get minimum depth of a binary tree.
