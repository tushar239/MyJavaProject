Threads
-------
    - There are two ways to create thread.

        1) Create Runnable's instance and pass it to Thread's constructor and create an instance of Thread.
          Start a Thread using threadInstance.start()

        public class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
            @Override
            public void run() {
                ...
            }
        }

        public class Client {
            MyRunnable runnable = new MyRunnable();

            Thread thread = new Thread(runnable);
            thread.start();
            ....
        }

        2) Create a subclass of Thread itself without a need of Runnable and override a run() method in that subclass.

        public class MyThread extends Thread {
            @Override
            public void run() {
                ...
            }
        }

        public class Client {
            MyThread thread = new MyThread();
            thread.start();
            ....
        }


    We try to avoid 2nd option because by extending a Thread class stops us using multiple inheritance.
        MyThread cannot extend anymore classes, whereas MyRunnable can.
    Also Thread class has a lot many other behaviours that we may not need to use. So, using a subclass of Runnable might be sufficient in most cases.

    - How do you start the thread?

        Thread thread = new Thread(runnable);
        thread.start();
        or
        MyThread thread = new MyThread();
        thread.start();

    - How do you sleep the thread?

      try {
        thread.sleep(milliseconds)
      } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        ...
      }

Synchronization & Locking
-------------------------
Two Types of synchronization

    - Method level synchronization
        - instance-level synchronization

            When you synchronize non-static(instance-level) method(s), that method can't be accessed my more than one thread at the same time, if both threads are trying to access that method for the same instance of the class at the same time.

            If threads use different instances of the class to access synchronized non-static method together at the same time, then they can access it together.
            If one thread is accessing one synchronized non-static method, another thread can access another synchronized non-static method for the same class instance. This is different than class-level (static method) synchronization.

        - class-level synchronization

            static-level(class level) synchronized method(s) can't be accessed by multiple threads.

            REMEMBER:
            If one thread is accessing one synchronized static method, another thread can't access another synchronized static method also. Because it acts like class-level locking.
            This is different than instance-level synchronization.

    - Block level synchronization (object level locking)

        Instead of synchronizing entire method, you can synchronize(lock) a block of the code inside a method.
        This is achieved by locking an access to an object.

Locks

    There are following types of locks:
        - ReentrantLock
        - ReentrantReadWriteLock

    ReentrantLock
    -------------
    Using ReentrantLock's lock() method on an object, thread can acquire a lock on that object.

    It is similar to block-level synchronization with certain major advantages.

        - lock on the object can be obtained inside one method and released inside another method.
        - multiple locks (holds on lock) can be acquired by same thread. But all the holds has to be released before any other thread can acquire a lock.
        - lock.tryLock(...) method
             If lock is not available to acquire, then

                  lock.tryLock() method
                        will return false immediately and will execute the code in method without locking applied. Basically, it will ignore locking applied by another thread.
                  lock.tryLock(time) method
                        will wait for lock to be released by another thread for some time.
                        If lock is released by another thread in that time duration, it will acquire a lock and return true and then execute the code in the method.
                        Otherwise, it will return false and execute the code in method without locking applied. Basically, it will ignore locking applied by another thread.

             Unlike to lock() method, it will not wait forever to acquire a lock.

        - Fairness policy
          new ReentrantLock(true) - fairness policy is set to true
          If multiple threads are waiting to acquire a lock, the longest waiting thread can be given a lock after a lock is released by current thread.

        - Condition
          Just like wait() and notifyAll(), you can use condition.await() to let current thread wait and let other thread acquire a lock. That other thread has to use condition.signal() that will notify waiting thread to acquire a lock again AFTER that other thread unlocks the lock.
          await(time) - if waiting thread is not signaled(notified) by another thread, then after sometime

        - lock.holdCount() method
          This method gives a count of total number of locks acquired by the CURRENT THREAD.
          A thread can hold multiple locks on the same lock object, but it has to release all locks before any other thread can acquire it.


    What is IllegalMonitorStateException?

        IMPORTANT: Lock can be unlocked thread who acquired it.

        If it you try to unlock a lock acquired by some other thread, then you will get this exception.
        So, it is important to check whether a lock is held by current thread before trying to unlock it.

        finally {
            if (lock.isHeldByCurrentThread()) {// do not use lock.isLocked() for unlocking purpose because it returns true, if lock is acquired by ANY thread.
                lock.unlock();
            }
        }

        Remember to unlock a lock inside finally block. If you don't and if method throws some exception before the lock is unlocked, then that lock will never be unlocked.

    ReentrantReadWriteLock
    ----------------------
    ReentrantReadWriteLock is similar to ReentrantLock with one more advantage.
    You can apply read and write locks.

    - Multiple threads can read the data at the same time, as long as thereâ€™s no thread is updating the data.
    - Only one thread can update the data at a time, causing other threads (both readers and writers) block until the write lock is released.
    - If a thread attempts to update the data while other threads are reading, the write thread also blocks until the read lock is released.

    lock.readLock().lock()
    lock.readLock().unlock()

    lock.writeLock().lock()
    lock.writeLock().unlock()

                               If lock is released by another thread in that time duration, it will acquire a lock and return true and then execute the code in the method.
                               Otherwise, it will return false and execute the code in method without locking applied. Basically, it will ignore locking applied by another thread.
