/*
  Method level synchronization

    - instance-level synchronization

        When you synchronize non-static(instance-level) method(s), that method can't be accessed my more than one thread at the same time, if both threads are trying to access that method for the same instance of the class at the same time.

        If threads use different instances of the class to access synchronized non-static method together at the same time, then they can access it together.
        If one thread is accessing one synchronized non-static method, another thread can access another synchronized non-static method for the same class instance. This is different than class-level (static method) synchronization.

    - class-level synchronization

        static-level(class level) synchronized method(s) can't be accessed by multiple threads.

        REMEMBER:
        If one thread is accessing one synchronized static method, another thread can't access another synchronized static method also. Because it acts like class-level locking.
        This is different than instance-level synchronization.
