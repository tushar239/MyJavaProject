Call In Order:
    Suppose we have the following code:
    public class Foo {
        public Foo() { ... }
        public void first() { ... }
        public void second() { ... }
        public void third() { ... }
    }
    The same instance of Foo will be passed to three different threads.
    ThreadA will call first(), ThreadB will call second() and ThreadC will call third() methods.
    You have to make sure that first() is called before second() and second() is called before third().

This algorithm is a good example of Semaphore usage.

Lock vs Semaphore:

        Semaphore is also like a ReentrantLock with a some improvements.

        ReentrantLock allows only one thread to access a block of code, whereas Semaphore allows more than 1 threads to acquire locks on the same block of code.
        Here, 3 threads can enter the block of the code and others have to wait until one of them releases lock.
            +
        The thread that acquires a lock on some ReentrantLock object, the same thread can release it. If some other thread tries to release it, java will throw IllegalMonitorStateException.
        That is why lock.unlock() has to be surrounded by 'if(lock.isHeldByCurrentThread())'
        Whereas, one thread can acquire a lock on semaphore object and some other thread can release it.

        You can also set fairness=true/false just like ReentrantLock.

        Semaphore semaphore = new Semaphore(3, <fairness true/false>);
