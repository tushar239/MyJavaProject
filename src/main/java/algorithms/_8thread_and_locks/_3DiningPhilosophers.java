Dining Philosophers:
There are some people sitting on a table for a dinner. Each person has one chopstick on its left and one on its right.
So, there is one chopstick between two persons on a table.
To start the dinner, a person needs to have both chopsticks. Each person will take left chopstick first and then right one.
After finishing the dinner, person has to put both chopsticks back.

Guess a situation when all people took their left chopsticks. Now, all will be waiting forever to get the right ones.
This will create a deadlock.
First write the code that creates a deadlock, the correct it in such a way that it doesn't create a deadlock.


This is a very nice problem that gives an opportunity to design objects properly and apply multi-threading and locking concepts.

Solution to remove a deadlock:
If a person can acquire on both left and right chopsticks, then only continue eating process, otherwise release the lock on a chopstick that it acquired a lock on.
This will release a deadlock.
Draw a diagram of a table, 4 person and 4 chopsticks between them and simulate above scenario to understand it better.

Here, there are 3 main entities:
- Person (Philosopher)
- Chopstick
- Table (PhilosopherChopsticksRelationManager)

Lock is a property of a Chopstick because when a person reserves a chopstick, lock is applied on a chopstick.
So, it is important to have a ReentrantLock as a property of ChopStick entity.

PhilosopherChopsticksRelationManager maintains the relationship between a Philosopher and two chopsticks using Map<Philosopher, ChopStick[]>.

There are helper classes like
- ChopStickReserver that locks/unlocks a ChopStick.
- EatingService that has letEat method that lets a philosopher reserve the chopsticks and then eat the food and then unreserve the chopsticks.
