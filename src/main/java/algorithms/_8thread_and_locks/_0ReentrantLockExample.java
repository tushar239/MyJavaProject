    There are following types of locks:
        - ReentrantLock
        - ReentrantReadWriteLock

    ReentrantLock
    -------------
    Using ReentrantLock's lock() method on an object, thread can acquire a lock on that object.

    It is similar to block-level synchronization with certain major advantages.

        - lock on the object can be obtained inside one method and released inside another method.
        - multiple locks (holds on lock) can be acquired by same thread. But all the holds has to be released before any other thread can acquire a lock.
        - lock.tryLock(...) method
             If lock is not available to acquire, then

                  lock.tryLock() method
                        will return false immediately and will execute the code in method without locking applied. Basically, it will ignore locking applied by another thread.
                  lock.tryLock(time) method
                        will wait for lock to be released by another thread for some time.
                        If lock is released by another thread in that time duration, it will acquire a lock and return true and then execute the code in the method.
                        Otherwise, it will return false and execute the code in method without locking applied. Basically, it will ignore locking applied by another thread.

             Unlike to lock() method, it will not wait forever to acquire a lock.

        - Fairness policy
          new ReentrantLock(true) - fairness policy is set to true
          If multiple threads are waiting to acquire a lock, the longest waiting thread can be given a lock after a lock is released by current thread.

        - Condition
          Just like wait() and notifyAll(), you can use condition.await() to let current thread wait and let other thread acquire a lock. That other thread has to use condition.signal() that will notify waiting thread to acquire a lock again AFTER that other thread unlocks the lock.
          await(time) - if waiting thread is not signaled(notified) by another thread, then after sometime

        - lock.holdCount() method
          This method gives a count of total number of locks acquired by the CURRENT THREAD.
          A thread can hold multiple locks on the same lock object, but it has to release all locks before any other thread can acquire it.


    What is IllegalMonitorStateException?

        IMPORTANT: Lock can be unlocked thread who acquired it.

        If it you try to unlock a lock acquired by some other thread, then you will get this exception.
        So, it is important to check whether a lock is held by current thread before trying to unlock it.

        finally {
            if (lock.isHeldByCurrentThread()) {// do not use lock.isLocked() for unlocking purpose because it returns true, if lock is acquired by ANY thread.
                lock.unlock();
            }
        }

        Remember to unlock a lock inside finally block. If you don't and if method throws some exception before the lock is unlocked, then that lock will never be unlocked.

    ReentrantReadWriteLock
    ----------------------
    ReentrantReadWriteLock is similar to ReentrantLock with one more advantage.
    You can apply read and write locks.

    - Multiple threads can read the data at the same time, as long as thereâ€™s no thread is updating the data.
    - Only one thread can update the data at a time, causing other threads (both readers and writers) block until the write lock is released.
    - If a thread attempts to update the data while other threads are reading, the write thread also blocks until the read lock is released.

    lock.readLock().lock()
    lock.readLock().unlock()

    lock.writeLock().lock()
    lock.writeLock().unlock()
