input = 0010 1111
swap bits of index 2 and 3 with bits at index 5 and 6.

Solution:
you need to preserve bits at 2 and 3 in one number and bits at 5 and 6 in another number.
see RotateBitsOfNumber.java

You need to set bits at index 2,3 and 5,6 to 0s.

Then you need to and this number with preserved numbers.
