Coins:
Given an infinite number of quarters(25 cents), dimes (10 cents), nickels (5 cents), and pennies (1 cent),
Write code to calculate the number of ways of representing n cents;

NOTE:
Fibonacci.java and TripleSteps.java are the best examples of Bottom-Up Dynamic programming using 1-D array for memoization.
Thinking 1-D is easier, if you first implement the algorithm in brute-force way.

This algorithm is the best example of Bottom-Up Dynamic programming using 2-D array for memoization.
It is harder to think brute-force way for this algorithm.
It is a lot easier to think Bottom-Up Dynamic programming way directly for this algorithm.

(Important)
For any approach of "Dynamic Programming" (Top-Bottom or Bottom-Up), it is mandatory that problem has
    - optimal substructure
      if problem can be divided into subproblems and the solutions of subproblems can be used to construct the solution of a bigger problem (basically you can use recursion)
        and
    - overlapping problems (like fibonacci.java)
      function with same input is called multiple times or functionâ€™s output depends on previously calculated output of the function with previous parameters.

If there is optimal substructure, but no overlapping problem, then you may be able to use "Greedy Algorithm".

(Important)
What do you need to think of a problem in "Bottom-Up Dynamic programming" way directly instead of thinking Brute-Force and Top-Down Dynamic Approach first?

    Do you remember, 0/1 Knapsack problem from Grokking Algorithm Book?
    It says that you need to know
    - how much weight your knapsack (backpack) can hold.
        Here, you are told that you can have max so and so amount.
    - how much each item that can be put in knapsack weighs (and valued)
        Here, you have coins as items. each coin has its amount(value).

        This algorithm is a good example of understanding how to start thinking Bottom-Up Dynamic programming right away instead of thinking about Recursion first.

        Read Dynamic Programming from 'README_grokking_algorithms_book_notes.docx'

        This is the perfect example of how to think the solution using bottom-up dynamic programming.

        When can you use dynamic programming?
            'Optimal Substructure and Overlapping Problem - Prerequisite for Dynamic Programming.mp4'
            when you have
            - optimal substructure - if problem can be divided into subproblems and the solutions of subproblems can be used to construct the solution of a bigger problem (basically you can use recursion)
            and
            - overlapping problems (like fibonacci.java) - function with same input is called multiple times.

            but not
            - overlapping problem


        Challenging part of below way of bottom-up dynamic approach is to find out a formula to calculate the result in each cell of the matrix.
        Watch above mentioned videos to understand that.

        - Always remember to start 1st row with 0 (one additional row is required).
          If you have 0 coins, there are 0 ways to get to any amount.

        - Always remember to start 1st col with 0 (one additional col is required).
          Later on, we will see how to determine the values in col 0.

        - At each row, you have current row coin and prev rows coins available for calculation.
          e.g. when you are on row 3, you have coins 1,2,3 available for calculation.

        - Don't initialize the value for 1st col right now. you start filling up the values from coins=1 and amount=1 cell (memo[1][1]) in above matrix.
          When you will try to determine the value of memo[2][2] (number of ways to get amount 2 with coins 1 and 2), you will figure out the whether the value of 1st col should be 1 or 0.

        - How to determine number of ways to get amount 4 with for with coins 1,2,3 (value for memo[3][4])?

            including number of ways with to get amount 4 with coins 1 and 2        +      number of ways to get amount 4 using coin 2

            ways with coins 1,2 for amount 4 = memo[2][4]                           +      to get amount=4, you need to include amount 1 to coin 3. so, 3+| 1 | = 4. So, to find out number of ways to get amount 1 with coins 1,2,3, you should get value from memo[3][1]

            So, memo[3][4] = memo[2][4] + memo[3][1]

        - How to decide the value of 1st col with amount 0, should it be 0 or 1?

            You will be able to determine it when you try to find out the value of memo[2][2] or memo[3][3] etc.
            e.g. number of ways to get amount 2 with coins 1 and 2 (memo[2][2]) are
            number of ways to get amount 2 with coins 1 (memo[1][2])
            (1+1)
                        +
            number of ways you can get amount 2 with coin 2. You know that this value has to be 1 to determine that a possible way is 2+0.
            what amount should you add to coin 2 to get amount 2?
            (2+0=2)
            You should find out number of ways to get amount 0 using coins 1 and 2 (memo[2][0)). Now, you know that to get expected result value of memo[2][0] should be 1. It cannot be 0.

        My thought process of how to work with 2-D problem
        --------------------------------------------------

        Coin Changing problem is 2-D because there are two dimensions - coins and amount.

        Can I use Bottom-Up Dynamic Approach to start with instead of Brute-Force?

            You can, if

            - It is hard to think Brute-Force to begin with
              If you can code Brute-Force, you can easily convert it into Top-Bottom Dynamic Approach.

            - It is a 0/1 knapsack kind of problem
              You knapsack(backpack) can hold some fixed amount of weight using various combinations of items available.
              It means that your one dimension has to have fixed range AT LEAST. Here amount is fixed and you can use a same coin infinitely to make up an amount).

        IMPORTANT:
            Whether you start with Bottom-Up Dynamic Approach or Brute-Force Approach for knapsack kind of problem,
            it is always better to draw a 2-D matrix on paper with one additional row and col (0th row and 0th col - it determines the most important exit condition) first.

            For normal matrix traversal problem like EightQueens.java and RobotInGrid.java, matrix is provided as an input. You are not solving knapsack problem there.
            So, you don't start matrix with additional row and col.

        IMPORTANT:
            If you choose to start with Bottom-Up Dynamic approach, first you need to fill up the matrix on paper starting from first cell.

        IMPORTANT:
            If you choose to go with Brute-Force (followed by Top-Bottom Dynamic Approach, if required),
            then also you draw a matrix on paper. You may not need to fill it up.

            When you think of recursion's reduce the problem by 1 approach, start from the last cell of the matrix (here amount=5 and coin=4)
            Why?
            Because normally, in 2-D problem, it is easier to think of a solution for the last element in drawn matrix instead of the first one.
            Here, it is easier to think that value at cell(4,5) depends on the values from its previous cells.


        IMPORTANT:
            There are two dimensions of this problem (coins and amount).
            So, you need to recurse this problem using both dimensions.

        It means that you need to recurse this problem using in 2-D, if you are using Brute-Force.

        There are 3 ways to solve 2-D problem:

            1) Total Imperative Approach:

              two loops (one loop for coins and another loop inside first one for amount)
              This is basically 100% imperative approach and very hard to code using Brute-Force. It is used for Bottom-Up Dynamic approach.
              You actually will not be able to use it for Brute-Force.

            2) Half Imperative-Half Recursive Approach:  ----- This is the easiest approach among all. I would normally use this approach.

               Use a loop for one of the dimension and use recursion for another dimension.

               Use a look for amount and recursion for coins.

                int count(int coins[], int coinsStartIndex, int coinsEndIndex, int amount) {
                    ... exit conditions ...

                    int lastCoin = coins[coinsEndIndex];

                    for (int amt = amount; amt >= 0; amt--) { // loop for amount
                        int totalWays = 0;

                        // sometimes it is hard to find out all conditions to determine the value for one coin
                        // Drawing matrix will help you. So remember to draw 2-D matrix for 2-D problems before you start writing the code.
                        int waysUsingLastCoin = ..... // This value is determined based on conditions (comparisons between amt and coin)

                        // recursion for coins
                        int waysUsingPrevCoins = count(coins, coinsStartIndex, coinsEndIndex - 1, amt); // recursion for coins

                        int totalWays = waysUsingLastCoin + waysUsingPrevCoins;
                        return totalWays;
                    }

                }

            3) Think of recursive approach for both dimensions (coins and amount).

               This approach is a bit harder than approach 2 as per my experience. So, I normally go with approach 2.


                int count(int coins[], int coinsStartIndex, int coinsEndIndex, int amount) {

                    ... exit conditions ...

                    int lastCoin = coins[coinsEndIndex];

                    int waysUsingLastCoin = ...;

                    // recurse using coins for the same amount
                    int waysUsingPrevCoins = count_brute_force_two_level_recursion(coins, coinsStartIndex, coinsEndIndex - 1, amount);

                    int totalWaysUsingLastCoinAndPrevCoins = waysUsingLastCoin + waysUsingPrevCoins;

                    // In this algorithm, amount level recursion is happening in the condition to determine waysUsingLastCoin. So, you don't need additional reducing amount by 1 as shown in below statement.
                    // But in other algorithms, you may need to do this and choose final return value using  totalWaysUsingLastCoinAndPrevCoins and totalWaysUsingCombinationsOfOtherCoinsAndAmount.

                    // int totalWaysUsingCombinationsOfOtherCoinsAndAmount = count_brute_force_two_level_recursion(coins, coinsStartIndex, coinsEndIndex, amount - 1);
                    // return (logic to determine final return value using totalWaysUsingLastCoinAndPrevCoins and totalWaysUsingCombinationsOfOtherCoinsAndAmount)

                    return totalWaysUsingLastCoinAndPrevCoins;
                }
