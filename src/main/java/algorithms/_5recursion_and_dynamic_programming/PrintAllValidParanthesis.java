    let's say requirement is to print all possible combinations of 3 paranthesis.
    valid combinations of 2 parenthesis - ()(), (())
    now iterate through these combinations:
        whereever you find '(' in entire string, add () after that. e.g. (()) (), () (())
        and at the end append () to entire string e.g. ()()()
        So, you made 3 combinations from ()() -  (()) (), () (()), ()()()
