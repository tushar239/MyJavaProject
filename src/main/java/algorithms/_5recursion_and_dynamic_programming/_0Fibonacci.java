Below code shows how can you write Fibonacci sequence code using
- Normal Recursion          - uses multiple stack frames
- Tail Recursion            - uses multiple stack frames in Java, but just one in Scala
- Tail Recursion using Java8 - uses one stack frame
- Memoized Recursion



                                            fib(5)
                   fib(4)                                       fib(3)
         fib(3)              fib(2)                 fib(2)                  fib(1)
    fib(2)   fib(1)     fib(1)  fib(0)          fib(1)  fib(0)
fib(1) fib(0)

Total number of nodes in the tree will represent the runtime, since each call only doesn O(1) work outside of its recursive calls. Therefore, the number of calls is the runtime.
How many nodes are there in the tree?
The root node has two children. Each of those children has two children (so four children total in the "grand children" level).
Each of those grandchildren has to children, and so on.
If we do this n times, we will have reoughly o(2^n) nodes. This gives us runtime of roughly O(2^n).

Actually, it's slightly better than O(2^n) because if you see the right subtree is slightly smaller than the left subtree.

This issue can be solved using Dynamic Programming techniques.
- Top-Down Dynamic Programming (or Memoization)
- Bottom-Up Dynamic Programming

Top-Down Dynamic Programming (or Memoization)
---------------------------------------------
    e.g.fibonacciRecursion_Memoization method


                                                fib(5)
                       fib(4)                                       fib(3)
             fib(3)              fib(2)
        fib(2)   fib(1)
    fib(1) fib(0)

    Result of fib(1), fib(0), fib(2), fib(3), fib(4) and fib(5) will be memoized. Repetitive calls to these methods will be avoided. and number of call will be reduced as shown above.
    This will improve runtime to approx O(n).

    - Basically, if you see above example, it's a Brute Force approach because you are calling the method with same parameter multiple times.
    Memoization can solve this problem (read RecursionConcepts.java)
    - It can also help to convert Normal Recursive method to Tail-Recursive method (read RecursionConcepts.java)

Bottom-Up Dynamic Programming
-----------------------------
    This avoids using Recursion.
    It stores base condition (exit condition) result (fib(1) and fib(0)) in some external variable like array or map etc just like Memoization
    and then it works bottom-up
        to calculate fib(2), it uses stored values of fib(1) and fib(0) and then it stores fib(2) value also.
        to calculate fib(3), it uses stored values of fib(2) and fib(1) and then it stores fib(3) value also.
        and so on.
    e.g. fibonacci_BottomUpDynamicProgramming method

In Functional programming, if you use tail-recursion, then using some trick, you can get away from using so many stack slots. you can using only one stack slot for entire recursion

    // In this case, when the last method call is pushed to stack, result is already computed. Ideally, you don't have to put all method call in the stack, you can use only one stack frame and overwrite it by each method call. Java doesn't support this, but Scala supports it. So, in scala recursion is very cheap.

        Top-Bottom Dynamic Programming (Memoization)
        --------------------------------------------

        Why Memoization is important?


                    fibRecursion1(4)
                     |
                  fibRecursion1(3)    +       fibRecursion1(2)
                     |                              |
                     |              fibRecursion1(1)+fibRecursion1(0)
                     |
                 fibRecursion1(2)+fibRecursion1(1)
                    |
                fibRecursion1(1)+fibRecursion1(0)

        If you see, fibRecursion1(2) is called twice. So, unnecessarily why to use stack for that.
        You can store the result of each fibRecursion1(n) call in a Map<2,result of fibRecursion1(2)> and before calling fibRecursion1(2) again check whether map already has its value.

        Memoization helps to save Stack memory. But needs heap memory for a Map which is better than using stack memory.
        Memoization is a solution of Java's Recursion disadvantages, but if you use Java 8's Tail-Recursion, then you don't need Memoization. It uses only one stack frame.
