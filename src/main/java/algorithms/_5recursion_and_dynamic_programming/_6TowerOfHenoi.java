Tower of Hanoi:
You have 3 stacks-origin, buffer and destination.
Origin is filled with 5 disks with largest on at the bottom and smallest on on the top in ascending size from top to bottom.
Arrange these disks in the destination stack in the same order.
Conditions:
You cannot reserve out more than one disks at a time. When you reserve out a disk, you need to put it in one of the stacks before you reserve out another.
When you put another disk on top of prev one, they should be stacked as per ascending size.


This algorithm is a classic example of recursion. This algorithm cannot be done easily without recursion. It will be super hard to write this algorithm without recursion.

watch 'Towers Of Hanoi Problem.mp4'. This video describes recursion very well.


Time Complexity:

Using Back Substitution strategy.

    TOH(n) = TOH(n-1) + C + TOH(n-1)   C=constant time operation
           = 2TOH(n-1) + C

    Calculate TOH(n-1) by replacing n to n-1 in TOH(n)

        TOH(n-1) = 2TOH(n-2) + C
        TOH(n-2) = 2TOH(n-3) + C

    Now lets's replace TOH(n-1) and then TOH(n-2) and so on... in original formula.

    TOH(n) = 2TOH(n-1) + C
           = 2 (2TOH(n-2) + C) + C
           = 2 (2 (2TOH(n-3) + C) + C) + C
           = 2^3 TOH(n-3) + 4C + 2C + C

    Now replace a constant that is changing at each step. It is 3 here.
           = 2^K TOH(n-K) + 4C + 2C + C

    Now let's replace TOH(n-k) with base condition.
    Our base condition is TOH(0)=do nothing
            n-k=0
            k=n

           = 2^n TOH(0) + 4C + 2C + C

           Ignoring the constants and replacing TOH(0)

           = 2^n


Using Recursive Tree Strategy:

Recursive tree looks ALMOST same as Fibonacci's recursion tree.

                                                    TOH(5)

                        TOH(4)                                                      TOH(4)

            TOH(3)                      TOH(3)                      TOH(3)                          TOH(3)

  TOH(2)            TOH(2)     TOH(2)           TOH(2)    TOH(2)            TOH(2)        TOH(2)            TOH(2)

TOH(1)TOH(1)    TOH(1)TOH(1) TOH(1)TOH(1)   TOH(1)TOH(1)TOH(1)TOH(1)    TOH(1)TOH(1)    TOH(1)TOH(1)    TOH(1)TOH(1)

Total number of nodes in this recursion tree = 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 +.....+ 2^n = 2^n+1 - 1 = O(2^n)

in each node of recursion tree, only one constant time operation is happening. So, time complexity is O(2^n)

NOTE:
As you can see all the calls are happening more than once.
TOH(4) is happening 2 times.
TOH(3) is happening 4 times.
TOH(2) is happening 8 times.
TOH(1) is happening 16 times.

Time complexity could be improved, if you could memoize the result of these calls.
You somehow need to memoize the state of origin,buffer and destination stacks for number of disks, which is not so easy.
