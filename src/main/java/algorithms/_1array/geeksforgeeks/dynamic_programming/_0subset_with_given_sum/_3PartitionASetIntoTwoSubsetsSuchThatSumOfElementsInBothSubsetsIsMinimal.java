Partition a set into two subsets such that the difference of subset sums is minimum
Given a set of integers, the task is to divide it into two sets S1 and S2 such that the absolute difference between their sums is minimum.

If there is a set S with n elements, then if we assume Subset1 has m elements, Subset2 must have n-m elements and the value of abs(sum(Subset1) â€“ sum(Subset2)) should be minimum.

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/partition-a-set-into-two-subsets-such-that-the-difference-of-subset-sums-is-minimum/

Example:

    Input:  arr[] = {1, 6, 11, 5}
    Output: 1
    Explanation:
    Subset1 = {1, 5, 6}, sum of Subset1 = 12
    Subset2 = {11}, sum of Subset2 = 11


This algorithm is an extension of
    FindIfASubsetWithGivenSumExistsInGivenArray.java
    and
    PartitionASetIntoTwoSubsetsSuchThatSumOfElementsInBothSubsetsAreEqual.java


            max expected sum of one subset
            0   1   2   ....   23/2=11
            -----------------------
   A    0 |
   r    1 |
   r    6 |
   a    11|
   y    5 |                      * ----- min( difference between expectedSum and all prev elements(excluding current element),
                                              difference between expectedSum and sum including this element
                                            )
                                 base conditions condition : if current element == expectedSum, then difference is 0
                                                             if current element is < or >, I still want to find the difference -- so it's not considered in base condition

        When you include current element (5):
            5 + 6 = 11
            so, column 6 and element 11's value will be the difference between 11 and 5.
