Given a string consisting of opening and closing parenthesis, find length of the longest valid parenthesis substring.

Examples:

Input : ((()
Output : 2
Explanation : ()

Input: )()())
Output : 4
Explanation: ()()

Input:  ()(()))))
Output: 6
Explanation:  ()(())


Solution:
    When opening bracket comes, push its index to stack and when closing bracket comes, calculate the difference between closing bracket index and top element of stack. This will give you a length of substring in between those brackets.
    Keep doing this till you iterate entire string.


IMPORTANT:
    When to use stack?

    When you need to find 'first possible .....' in remaining array.
    See 'FindFirstGreaterElementFromNextElementForEveryElement.java'.

    Here, you need to find 'first possible closing bracket( ')' )' for an opening bracket.
