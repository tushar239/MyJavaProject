    Find the two repeating elements in a given array

    https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-the-two-repeating-elements-in-a-given-array/

    You are given an array of n+2 elements. All elements of the array are in range 1 to n. And all elements occur once except two numbers which occur twice. Find the two repeating numbers.

    For example, array = {4, 2, 4, 5, 2, 3, 1} and n = 5

    The above array has n + 2 = 7 elements with all elements occurring once except 2 and 4 which occur twice. So the output should be 4 2.


    Solution:

    This problem is same as FindDuplicatesFromPositiveNumbers.java
