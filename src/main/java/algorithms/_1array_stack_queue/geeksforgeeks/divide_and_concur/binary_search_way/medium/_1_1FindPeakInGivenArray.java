Find a peak element

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-a-peak-in-a-given-array/

Given an array of integers. Find a peak element in it.
An array element is peak if it is NOT smaller than its neighbors.
For corner elements, we need to consider only one neighbor.
For example,
    For input array {5, 10, 20, 15}, 20 is the only peak element.
    For input array {10, 20, 15, 2, 23, 90, 67}, there are two peak elements: 20 and 90.

Note that we need to return any one peak element.


Solution:
    Brute-Force: Compare every element with its neighbours and find a pick element. This takes O(n).
    Better Approach: Use Binary Search kind of solution. This takes O(log n)


    A = {10, 20, 15, 40, 23, 90, 67}
    middle=40, so it's a peak element

    A = {10, 40, 30, 2, 15, 90, 67}
    middle=2 and 2 is not a peak
    but 30 is >= 2, so one peak element must be found on left side of middle element

    A = {10, 20, 15, 2, 23, 90, 67}
    middle=2 and 2 is not a peak
    but 23 is >= 2, so one peak element must be found on right side of middle element

Important:

    - If you need to find ALL peak elements, you can do it in Brute-Force O(n) way and that's the best way.
    You can't reduce it to O(log n) because you need to find peaks on both sides of middle element (not just one side), if you use divide and conquer.

    - This algorithm teaches you some important concepts to remember when you are doing Divide and Conquer.

     It is very important to remember that when you do divide and conquer, you cannot pass 'mid' as an 'end' index in recursive call e.g. findPeak(A,start,mid)
     If you do that, it will end up in infinite recursion.
     Because at some point mid=1 will come. At this point, when you do findPeak(A,start=0,mid=1), in this call again mid=(0+1)/2=1. So, you will infinitely end up calling findPeak(A,0,1).
     So, always use findPeak(A,start,mid-1 / mid+1) in recursive call.

     So, always use findPeak(A,start,mid-1 / mid+1) in recursive call.

     - When you need to to access
        A[mid-1], it is must to check whether mid < 0
        A[mid+1], it is must to check whether mid > A.length-1

     - When you have an exit condition to check start==end, then you need to have a sense that
     if your array is 1,2,3 and start and end pointers are at 3 (at the end) or at 1 (at the beginning), what should you do?

     - In below algorithm, you are checking for start==end because you know that recursion is increasing/decreasing the index by one only. so, at some point start can become end.
     In Binary Search related algorithm, you can remember that you can avoid start==end check and keep start>end check
