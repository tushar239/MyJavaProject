    k-th missing element in sorted array

    https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/k-th-missing-element-in-sorted-array/

    Given an increasing sequence a[], we need to find the K-th missing contiguous element in the increasing sequence which is not present in the sequence. If no k-th missing element is there output -1.

    Examples:

    Input :   a[] = {2, 3, 5, 9, 10};
                k = 1;
    Output : 4
    Explanation: Missing Element in the increasing
    sequence are {4, 6, 7, 8}. So k-th missing element
    is 4

    Input : a[] = {2, 3, 5, 9, 10, 11, 12};
              k = 4;
    Output : 8
    Explanation: missing element in the increasing
    sequence are {4, 6, 7, 8}  so k-th missing
    element is 8
