/*
Find the max diff between any two elements of an array.
Condition is bigger element should appear after smaller in chosen elements. (this condition makes the algorithm trickier)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SO0bwMziLlU


e.g. [2,3,10,6,4,8,1]
difference between 2 and 10 will be max. That will be 8.


There is a Brute-Force approach that takes O(n^2).
    You can compare every single element every other and find the max difference by keeping in mind that smaller element appears before bigger one

There is a trickier and better approach that takes O(n).
    Keep track of min_element and find the difference of that with other elements and keep track of max diff.

If you don't have a restriction of 'bigger element should appear after smaller in chosen elements', then you can definitely use above trickier solution, but there could be an easier solution also.
You could sort an array and find the difference between first and last element.

Remember, Finding min diff solution is different than finding max.
For finding min diff, see MinimumDifferenceBetweenTwoElementsOfAnArray
