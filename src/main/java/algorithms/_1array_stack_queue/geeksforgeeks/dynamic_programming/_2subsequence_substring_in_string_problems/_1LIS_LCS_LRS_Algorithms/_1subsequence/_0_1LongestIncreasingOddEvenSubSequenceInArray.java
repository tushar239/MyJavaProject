    Longest Increasing Odd Even Subsequence

    https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/longest-increasing-odd-even-subsequence/

    Input : arr[] = {5, 6, 9, 4, 7, 8}
    Output : 4
    {5, 6, 7, 8} is the required longest increasing odd even subsequence.

    This algorithm is an extension to LongestIncreasingSubSequenceInArray.java
