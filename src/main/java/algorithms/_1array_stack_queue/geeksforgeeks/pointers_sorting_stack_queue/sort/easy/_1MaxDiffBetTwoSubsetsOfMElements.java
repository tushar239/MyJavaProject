Maximum difference between two subsets of m elements
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-maximum-sum-minimum-sum-n-m-elementsin-review/

Input : arr[] = 1 2 3 4 5     m = 4

Output : 4
    The maximum four elements are 2, 3,
    4 and 5. The minimum four elements are
    1, 2, 3 and 4. The difference between

    two sums is (2 + 3 + 4 + 5) - (1 + 2+ 3 + 4) = 4


Input : arr[] = 5 8 11 40 15    m = 2

Output : 42

The difference is (48 + 15) - (5  + 8)


Solution:
- sort the array
- find sum of first m elements and sum of last m elements
- Finally return difference between two sums
