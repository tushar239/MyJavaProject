    Sort a stack using recursion

    https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sort-a-stack-using-recursion/

    It's a simple concept of reducing the problem by one.

   ___
   |3|  --- reduce the problem by 1 by popping first element
   ---
   ---
   |1|  --- sort rest of the stack
   |4|
   |2|
   |5|
   ---

   Assuming that rest of the stack will be sorted using recursion

   ___
   |3|  --- reduce the problem by 1 by popping first element
   ---
   ---
   |5|  --- sorted rest of the stack
   |4|
   |2|
   |1|
   ---

   Now, to insert 3 in sorted stack, you need to iterate through entire rest of the stack. You can use staging stack during this process.


   NOTE:
   Queue can also be sorted using two additional stacks.

   Queue can also be sorted without using additional data structure or recursion (See SortQueueWithoutUsingAnyExtraSpace.java).
   But Stack can't be sorted without using additional data structure.
