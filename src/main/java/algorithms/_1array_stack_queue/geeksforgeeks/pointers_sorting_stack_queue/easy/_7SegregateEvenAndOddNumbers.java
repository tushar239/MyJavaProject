    Segregate Even and Odd numbers

    https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/segregate-even-and-odd-numbers/

    Given an array A[], write a function that segregates even and odd numbers. The functions should put all even numbers first, and then odd numbers.

    Example

    Input  = {12, 34, 45, 9, 8, 90, 3}
    Output = {12, 34, 8, 90, 45, 9, 3}

    Solution:

    1) Initialize two index variables left and right:
                left = 0,  right = size -1
    2) Keep incrementing left index until we see an odd number.
    3) Keep decrementing right index until we see an even number.
    4) If lef < right then swap arr[left] and arr[right]
