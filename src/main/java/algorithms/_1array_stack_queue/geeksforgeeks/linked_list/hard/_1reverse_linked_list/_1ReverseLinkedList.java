   Reverse a Linked List:

   https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reverse-a-linked-list/


    Recursive approach:

       This is very important algorithm to understand the recursion in Linked List.

        It is is easy to think recursive when you want to reverse a Linked List. It is hard to reverse a sublist using recursion (ReverseSubListOfLinkedList.java). So, memorize iterative approach also along with recursive approach.

        1---->2---->3---->null

        Reducing the problem by 1.

        After recursive call (reversing rest of the linked list), situation will be as shown below

       head    newHeadNode
        1       3--------->2 ----> null
        |                  ^
        |                  |
        --------------------

        Now, just do

        head.next.next = head
        head.next = null
        head = newHeadNode

        1 -> 2 -> 3

        For reversing the linked list, you just need to reverse the arrow direction between two nodes.

        1 <- 2    3
        1 <- 2 <- 3
                  head

        At the end, head should eventually be pointed to last element.

        See reverseIteratively method.

        You need three pointers - Start, Next, NextNext

       start      next   nextnext

       head

       reverse the link between start(1) and next(2).

       next.next = start
       if(start.next == next) start.next = null;   This is an important condition. You break the link between start and next, only if next is start's next.

                  start      next   nextnext
        1       <- 2         3     -> null
       head


       next.next = start
       start.next = null is not needed here because start.next != next. If you do that, link will be broken between 2 and 1

                  start      next   nextnext
        1       <- 2       <- 3     -> null
       head


        Now, nextnext == null, so new head of the linked list is 'next'. So, return 'next' as a new head or simply point 'head' to 'next'.


      It's a complicated algorithm, you need to memorize it.
