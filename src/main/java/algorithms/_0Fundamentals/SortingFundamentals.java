     COMPARISON SORTS
        BSIS

            Bubble – in place – execution time O(n^2) to O(n^2)
            Selection – in place – execution time O(n^2) to O(n^2)
            Insertion – in place – execution time O(n) to O(n^2) -------- Insertion Sort is the best sorting algorithm for almost sorted array
            Shell (h-sort) - in place - execution time O(n^3/2) to O(n^7/6) --- so far nobody could determine correct execution time

        BSIS, Insertion(I) is better because it gives O(n) best cases (when array is almost sorted)

        M-HQ  (M is not in-place sorting, but it is stable) (HQ are in-place, but they are unstable)

            Merge – not in place
                    space complexity is O(2n) for arrays and O(log n) for stack
                    execution time is ALWAYS O(n log n)
            Heap – in place
                   requires to maintain heap(binary heap tree - aux array)
                   execution time O(n log n) not stable
            Quick – in place
                    execution time O(n log n) to O(n^2). In most practical scenarios, it gives O(n logn)
                    not stable
                    Try to sort [2, 5, 7, 5] by keeping pivot as last index. you will realize that at some point you need to exchange pIndex 5 with pivot 5.
                    (IMPORTANT) Quick Sort can be made Stable, when the pivot chosen is ensured to be of a unique key.
                                You can write a quick sort using aux arrays also just like merge sort, but it is not advisable to do so. See notInPlaceQuickSort method.

        - Arrays.sort uses 3-Way-QuickSort for int[], float[] etc. But it uses Merge Sort/Insertion Sort for Object[].
          If positions for primitives are changed during sorting, then it's ok, but it's not ok for Objects.
        - Collections.sort uses Arrays.sort internally.
          Collections.sort(...) uses insertion sort for smaller number of Object elements and deleteRootAndMergeItsLeftAndRight sort for large number of elements
        - Heap Sort uses Binary Heap algorithm and Priority Queue uses Heap Sort. (BH -> HS -> PQ)

     NON-COMPARISON SORTS

        Best Comparison sort gives at the most O(n log n) time complexity in worst case, but is there any sorting algorithm that can give O(n) time complexity in worst case?
            Yes, Bucket sort, but with some conditions.
            It gives time complexity O(nb) in worst case and space complexity O(n+b) where b is a number of buckets.

        Bucket Sort - Stable, not in-place
            None of the COMPARISON sort gives O(n) time complexity in worst case. Bucket sort gives it, but with following CONDITIONS.
            1. Bucket sort is mainly useful when input is uniformly distributed over a range. Uniformly distributed means linkedlists inside each bucket gets almost same number of elements.
            2. Used in special cases when the key can be used to calculate the address of buckets.
         It internally uses COMPARISON sort for sorting each bucket.


    BST+In-Order Traversal

        It uses o(n) space.
        O(n^2) time in worst case to create BST of all elements.
        O(n) time to do in-order traversal of entire tree.

        This method is useful only when there are too many duplicates, so that it takes <= O(n log n) time to create BST.
        Alternatively, you can use 3-way quick sort also, if there are too many duplicates

        If there are duplicates, you can maintain the count inside each node of BST. In this way, total number of nodes in BST will be less.


What is stability?
http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/247440/what-does-it-mean-for-a-sorting-algorithm-to-be-stable


Which sorting algorithm to be used?
http://www.academia.edu/1976253/Selection_of_Best_Sorting_Algorithm

This explains why Java uses Insertion and Merge sorts when doing Collections.sort(collection).
If number of elements are less, then it uses Insertion Sort, otherwise it uses Merge Sort
Insertion Sort is good for mostly sorted less number of elements.

Comparison Sorts

    Bubble Sort

        1.Straightforward, simple and slow
        2.Stable.
        3.Inefficient on large tables.

    Selection Sort

        1. Improves the performance of bubble sort and also slow.
        2. Unstable but can be implemented as a stable sort.
        3. Quite slow for large amount of data.

    Insertion Sort (stable, good for mostly sorted array)

        1.EFFICIENT for small list and MOSTLY SORTED List because execution time is O(n) to O(n^2)
        2.Sort big array slowly
        3.Save memory

    Shell Sort

        1.Efficient for large nilList
        2.It requires relative small amount of memory, extension of insertion sort
        3.Fastest algorithm for small nilList of elements.
        4.More constraints, UNSTABLE.

    Heap Sort (good for O(1) time to find min/max, priority queue, k-sorted array)

        1.More efficient version of selection sort.
        2.No need extra buffer
        3.Its does not require recursion
        4.Slower than Quick and Merge sorts.
        MOST IMPORTANT
        5.Heap Sort is very useful when you need to find min/max in O(1) time and insert an element in O(log n) time. It requires an aux array through. so O(n) space and total execution time is O(n log n).
        6. Java's PRIORITY QUEUE uses this Sorting

        IMP: Usage of Binary Heap
             - Find min/max in O(1) time
             - Creating Priority Queue (BH -> HS -> PQ)
             - When data is flowing from multiple streams and you want to find min/max element at any given point in time.
               As data comes, keep inserting them in min/max heap. At any given point in time, you can find min/max element.
             - Sorting k-sorted array (when every element in an array is k positions away from its actual position in sorted array)
               For k-sorted array, insertion sort takes O(nk), while heap sort takes O(n log k)

               e.g. SortKSortedArray.java

       IMP: Time Complexity to create a Binary Heap from an array.
            To insert/delete an element in/from a Binary Heap takes O(log n).
            So, you must be thinking that creating a Binary Heap for n elements takes O(n log n), but that is not true.
            see https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/?p=12580
            It takes close to O(n) only.


    Merge Sort (stable, takes O(n log n), uses O(2n) extra space)

        1.Well for very LARGE nilList, STABLE sort.
        2.A fast recursive sorting
        3.Both useful for internal and external sorting
        4.It requires an auxiliary array that is as large as the original array to be sorted.

        e.g. CountInversionsInAnArray.java

    Quick Sort (unstable, takes O(n log n) in average case and O(n^2) for sorted array)

        1.Fastest sorting algorithm in practice but sometime Unbalanced partition can lead to very slow sort.
        2.Available in many standard libraries.
        3.O(log n) space usage.
        4.UNSTABLE sort and complex for choosing a good pivot element.
          Try to sort [2, 5, 7, 5] by keeping pivot as last index. you will realize that at some point you need to exchange pIndex 5 with pivot 5.
          Quick Sort can be made Stable, when the pivot chosen is ensured to be of a unique key.

        (IMP) If quicksort is O(n log n) on average, but merge sort is O(n log n) always, why not use merge sort? Isn’t it faster?
        Quicksort has a smaller constant than merge sort. So if they’re both O(n log n) time, quicksort is faster. And quicksort is faster in practice because it hits the average case way more often than the worst case.
        Constant time is something that is taken to do each operation. O notation doesn't reserve time into consideration. It takes only number of operations into consideration.
        +
        Merge sort needs auxiliary arrays. Quick sort can be done in-place.

        (IMP)
        To sort an array of integers, quick sort takes O(n log n), we know that. During quick sort, when comparison of 2 integers happens, it takes O(1). Look at Integer class’ compareTo method.
        But in case of Strings, to compare two strings of size s takes O(s). So, sorting of strings will reserve O(sn log n).
        pg 49 of CCA book.

        3-Way Quick Sort
        It is useful when you have many duplicates.
        It has two pIndexes.

         pIndexLow                               pIndexHigh
            7       6       6       6       6       1
            i                                     pivot


         At some point

            1   6   6   6   6   7
                L           H

         Basically, you don't have to sort elements from L to H. You always sort elements before L and after H.

        _3wayQS(A, start, end) {
            ...
            when A[pivot] > A[i], exchange (A[i], A[pIndexLow]),  pIndexLow++, i++
            when A[pivot] < A[i], exchange (A[i], A[pIndexHigh]), pIndexHigh--
            when A[pivot] == A[i], i++

            _3wayQS(A, start, pIndexLow-1)
            _3wayQS(A, pIndexHigh+1, end)
        }


    e.g. FindKthLargestElement.java
         See CountInversionsInAnArray.java also, where you cannot use Quick Sort. Merge Sort is better for this algorithm.

Non-Comparison Sorts  (BCR - Bucket, Counting, Radix sorts)

    None of the comparison sorts gives better than O(n log n) performance.
    Non-Comparison sorts can give better performance O(n).


    Bucket Sort

        https://pbalasundar.wordpress.com/2012/05/31/bucket-sort/
        https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bucket-sort-2/

        It distributes the array elements into buckets. Each bucket is sorted using either comparison/non-comparison sort.
        Time Complexity = Average case is O(n+k) where k is a size of bucket.
                          Worst case where buckets are not created carefully to distribute the elements uniformly and a few buckets get a lot of elements whereas others are almost empty, then time complexity will be closer to O(n^2).

        1.IMP - Bucket sort is mainly useful when input is uniformly distributed over a range (buckets). Uniformly distributed means linked lists inside each bucket gets almost same number of elements.
        2.IMP - Used in special cases when the key can be used to calculate the address of buckets.
        3.None of the Comparison sort gives ~O(n) time complexity in worst case. Bucket sort gives it, but with CONDITIONS like point 1,2.
        4.Stable, fast. Fast because each bucket is of small size and can be sorted separately in O(nk) time complexity.
            IMP - Each bucket is sorted using any COMPARISON sort algorithm like Insertion Sort. As each bucket will have small number of elements, insertion sort is better from stability and speed perspective.
        5.Valid only in range 0 to some maximum value M.

        6. You can use bucket sort for Strings or other objects also as far as you can decide the bucket number based on string or object value.

    Counting Sort (good for ranged numbers)

        You need to create a 'counting array' of size 'max element' in array. It acts like a staging array between input array and output array.

        https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/counting-sort/
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zuGmKfUt7s

        1.Stable, used for REPEATED values
        2.Often used as a subroutine in RADIX sort
        3.Counting sort is efficient if the range of input data is not significantly greater than the number of objects to be sorted.
          e.g. Consider the situation where the input sequence is between range 1 to 10K and the data is 10, 5, 10K, 5K.

        4. The counting sort algorithm is designed to sort integer values that are in a fixed range, so it can't be applied to sort strings
           For floats/doubles, you can convert them into integers by multiplying them by 100 or 1000 etc and then do counting sort on integer values.
           After sorting you can convert them back to floats/doubles.
           e.g. 1.2, 1.5, 1.33
           all these numbers can be multiplied by 100
           120, 150, 133
           you can now sort them and convert them back to floats by dividing them by 100
           1.2, 1.33, 1.5


        Space Complexity is  Counting Array of size max element in an array + Aux array of size n
        Time complexity is ALWAYS O(n+k), where k is a size of array that is used to store the counts.

        It can be used only for numbers

        Here, size of count array has to be same as max element in the array.
        e.g. array = 10, 5, 10K, 5K
        count array has to be of size 10k. This is not efficient because number of elements are just 4 and for that you need count array of size 10k.

    Radix Sort

        https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/radix-sort/

        A Radix Sort internally uses Counting Sort, it can be used only for numbers.
        It needs counting array just from 0 to 9, which avoids the disadvantage of counting sort of having counting array of size same as max element in an array.
        It count sorts the elements for the 10th place then 100th place and then 1000 place and so on. To find max place, you need to know the max number in the array.

        Time complexity = O(n) to know max number + O(no of digits in number * n)

        Original, unsorted list:

        170, 45, 75, 90, 802, 24, 2, 66

        Sorting by least significant digit (1s place) gives: [*Notice that we keep 802 before 2, because 802 occurred before 2 in the original list, and similarly for pairs 170 & 90 and 45 & 75.]
        170, 90, 802, 2, 24, 45, 75, 66
          -   -    -  -   -   -   -   -

        Sorting by next digit (10s place) gives: [*Notice that 802 again comes before 2 as 802 comes before 2 in the previous list.]
        802, 2, 24, 45, 66, 170, 75, 90
         -      -   -   -    -   -   -

        Sorting by most significant digit (100s place) gives:
        2, 24, 45, 66, 75, 90, 170, 802


        1.Stable, straight forward code.
        2.Used by the card-sorting machines.
        3.Used to sort records that are keyed by multiple fields like date (Year, month and day)
        4.Radix sort can be used with or without Counting Sort. If you are using Counting Sort then Radix Sort = Doing Counting Sort in for loop for each digit in elements.

        Why Radix Sort is not being used universally in libraries?
        https://www.quora.com/If-Radix-sort-has-a-better-time-complexity-why-is-quick-sort-preferred-both-in-APIs-and-in-terms-of-interviews
            1. Quicksort is universal, while radix sort is only useful for fix length integer keys.
            2. Radix sort has variable space requirement. Bad scalability. Quicksort requires no extra memory.
            3. Time complexity of radix sort is O(n) which is k∗n, the constant factor k depends upon the number of bits in the integers sorted . For quicksort k∗nlogn the constant factor is actually a constant and is very small.
            4. More memory requirements in Radix sort leads to more cache misses and more page faults as the input size grows.

    When to use which Non-Comparison Sort?
        Bucket sort is good, if you know the range of elements and elements are distributed uniformly.
        Counting sort is good, if you know the range of elements and range of elements is not significantly greater than the number of objects to be sorted.
            Counting sort needs needs large counts array of size max-min+1.
            If input sequence is between range 1 to 10K and the elements are 10, 5, 10K, 5K, then it will create an counts array of size 10K for counting only 4 elements. It is not effective.
        If these requirements are not met, then Radix sort is a solution where you actually need an array of size only 10 and there is no range restriction.



    how to do non-comparison sorts for floats/words?????????????????????


    Why isn't heap sort preferred over quick sort even though it has O(n log n) complexity?
        https://www.quora.com/Why-isnt-heap-sort-preferred-over-quick-sort-even-though-it-has-O-nlgn-complexity
        Heap sort needs to create binary heap (aux array) whereas quick sort doesn't need any extra space.


    IMPORTANT -
        If you want just first sorted 10 element from thousands of elements.
        You partition once and then check whether number of element on left of pIndex <=9. if not then keep doing quicksort on left side of pivot.
        till pIndex > 10, keep copying array from 0 to pIndex-1 to another aux array.
        If pIndex == 10 then copy 0 to pIndex-1 to aux array.
        If pIndex < 10 then consider previously create aux array that might have more than 10 elements.
        do insertion sort (stable sort) on aux array and grab 1st 10 elements from that aux array.

        In this case, you never have to sort an array from pIndex+1 to end. It beans execution time of Quick sort will reduce drastically.
        But it requires an aux array to be created.


    You can not use a deleteRootAndMergeItsLeftAndRight sort in this case because in deleteRootAndMergeItsLeftAndRight sort till the first two L and R are merged, it is not guaranteed that L array will have elements which are <= elements in R array.
    Another way to see it, when we create L and R from A, we do it without sorting A, so R can have element >= elements in L. So, till the concur, elements won't be sorted.

    In quick sort, when we partition an array, it is guaranteed that left elements from from 0 to pIndex-1 are always sorted.


    How to get random number from an array?

        new Random().nextInt(number+1) gives a random number from 0 to number.

        To have similar functionality in case of array with array’s start and end index provided,

        int pivot = new Random().nextInt((end - start) + 1) + start;

        This functionality is used to choose a pivot in quick sort.

    How to Shuffle an array?

        private static <T> void shuffle(Comparable<T>[] numbers) {

            Random random = new Random();

            for (int i = 1; i < numbers.length; i++) {
                // pick random number between 0 and i
                // People sometimes choose random number between 0 and n-1, but it doesn't give uniformly random result

                int randomArrayIndex = random.nextInt(i);

                exchange(numbers, i, randomArrayIndex);
            }
            System.out.println("Shuffled Array:" + Arrays.asList(numbers));
        }

      Just like Merge Sort, Quick Sort is also Divide and Concur algorithm.
      Just like Merge Sort, you can create aux arrays in Quick Sort also (see notInPlaceQuickSort method), but better approach is to do quick sort in-place.
      This teaches us a trick: whenever you need to do something in-place, think of using an additional pointer. One pointer is for normal traversal of an array and another pointer increments on some special condition. Hard thing is to find this special condition.

       You have two choices to remove the worst case scenario when input array is already sorted.
       - shuffle an array and choose last element as a pivot
       - choose random pivot (no shuffling is required)
       2nd option is better

       i
       5       3       1       6       4       2
       pIndex                                  pivot

        if pivot > i, then exchange i with pIndex and increase both i and pindex
        otherwise just increase i

                        i
        5       3       1       6       4       2
        pIndex                                  pivot


        exchange i with pIndex and move pIndex by 1

                                i
        1       3       5       6       4       2
                pIndex


        Finally, you exchange pivot and pIndex.

        you will collect smaller elements than pivot on left side of the pivot and all bigger elements than pivot on its right side


        1     |  2  |     5       6       4       3


     To understand how the O notation value is calculated, read 'readme.docx'


    (IMP)
    To sort an array of integers, quick sort takes O(n log n), we know that. During quick sort, when comparison of 2 integers happens, it takes O(1). Look at Integer class’ compareTo method.
    But in case of Strings, to compare two strings of size s takes O(s). So, sorting of strings will reserve O(sn log n).
