 What is Graph?
 Graphs are made up of nodes and edges. A node can be directly connected to many other nodes. Those nodes are called its neighbors.


 Directed Graph - relationship between vertices are mentioned using edge(s) with arrow(s).
 UnDirected Graph - there is an edge without arrow between two vertices.

 A ---> B (Directed Graph). Relationship between A and B is mentioned through an Edge between them. Edge can have name, value, weight etc. properties.
 Unidirectional graph is called a tree. A tree is a special type of graph, where no edges ever point back.
 As there is only one way street (you can go from A to B, but not from B to A), so it is ACYCLIC graph also.


 A----B    (Undirected Graph)

    is same as

 A ----> B   (Directed Graph both ways)
   <----
 This is called CYCLIC Graph.

 BFS (Breath First Search) algorithm is used to find
 - Is Vertex connected to graph that you are searching in?
 - Is there a path from node A to node B?
 - What is the shortest path from node A to node B? (Not the fastest path. For fastest path, you need to use Dijkstra's algorithm that works for weighted graphs)


 BiDirectional BFS Search
 pg 109 of Cracking Coding Interview book
 You can use BiDirectional BFS Search to find shortest path between two nodes.
 You need to start BFS from both nodes and stop when they intersect


 BFS vs DFS
 - BFS uses queue. DFS uses stack.
 - BFS needs more memory compared to DFS.
   Because in BFS, you put all adjacent(connected) vertices of a vertex in a queue (Level First - vertices on the same level are pushed together in queue).
   DFS is a depth first search, so you go all the way far and till then you put only one-one vertex on stack and before you put next vertex of the same level on stack, you poll the last pushed vertex from stack. So, DFS needs less memory.
 - If you don't have a space problem, use BFS because it is an ideal algorithm to find shortest distance between two vertices.
   Use DFS only if you want to know Topological order of the vertices.
   Topological Order - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddTC4Zovtbc  (Downloaded 'Topological Sort Graph Algorithm Using DFS.mp4')
 - BFS works on both cyclic/acyclic and directed/undirected graphs, whereas DFS works only on directed acyclic graph, then only toplogical dependency makes sense.

 BFS                                                                        DFS
- uses queue                                                                - uses stack
- It does Level Ordering Traversal. Means vertices on same level            - it does Depth First Search. It means that it finds ANY ONE (not all) unvisited friend of a vertex and pushes to stack and visits it while PEEKing it from stack.
  in graph are visited and pushed to queue together
- works on directed/undirected cyclic/acyclic all types of graphs           - works on DIRECTED ACYCLIC graph only.
- used to know SHORTEST path from A to B (Not Fastest Path)                 - used to know TOPOLOGICAL Order of vertices
- vertices are visited when they are PUSHED to queue                        - vertex is visited when it is PUSED to stack. vertex is POLLED when all its friends are visited.
- In average case, BFS is faster than DFS in searching
  but space complexity is highre than DFS. See the explnation below.


Time complexity of a graph is O(V+E).  ------- I am kind of not agreed to this explanation
  If you search your entire network for a mango seller, that means you’ll follow each edge (remember, an edge is the arrow or connection from one person to another). So the running time is at least O(number of edges).
  You also keep a queue of every person to search. Adding one person to the queue takes constant time: O(1). Doing this for every person will reserve O(number of people) total.
  Breadth-first search takes O(number of people + number of edges), and it’s more commonly written as O(V+E) (V for number of vertices, E for number of edges).


Space and Time complexity of BFS and DFS
    b is number of branches
    d is the depth of a graph

                      o                         E^0

    o                 o                 o       E^1

 o  o  o        o   o   o           o   o   o   E^2

Assuming that every vertex has E number of edges and height(depth) of the graph is D

Time Complexity:

    In worst case, if the node that we are searching for is at the bottom right corner, then we need to visit E^0+E^1+E^2+....+E^D = E^D+1 - 1 = O(E^D) is the time complexity of BFS and DFS searches.
    Normally, BFS is faster than DFS because if you want to search a last node in second level, BFS will be faster because you visit the node level wise.
              In DFS, you visit entire depth first. So, search will be slower.

Space Complexity:

    In BFS, you will have around E^D nodes in a queue at a time.
    In DFS, you will have only D+1 nodes in a stack at a time.
    So, space complexity wise, DFS is better than BFS.


What is Topological Ordering/Sorting?
 when you have packages in your project and one package depends on another, compiler needs to build dependent package first before dependee package. This is called topological sorting.
 In DFS, order of Popping of elements from stack will give you Topological Order.
 Topological order makes sense for 'Acyclic Graph'.


Dijkstra's Algorithm
- used to know FASTEST PATH from A to B.
- Works on graph with EDGES with WEIGHTS.
- It does not use Queue/Stack. It maintains a Vertex|Cost|Parent table.
- It works only on ACYCLIC DIRECTED Graph with POSITIVE WEIGHTS of edges.
- You can call this algorithm PARTIALLY GREEDY Algorithm also because it starts with Lowest cost edge (Locally Optimal Solution) without thinking of entire graph and at the end it reaches to final solution (Globally Optimal Solution).
  But unlike to Dijkstra's Algorithm, Greedy Algorithm may not find optimal solution at the end.
  Dijkstra's Algorithm always find MOST OPTIMAL FASTEST PATH at the end because it doesn't visit already visited vertices.

         2                              Vertex  Cost                     Parent
      A -----> B                           A     0                          -
      |         \ 10                       B     2                          A
      |         v                          C     4                          A
      |--------- C ---> D                  D     6 (it will never be 14)    C
            4       2
                                        Fastest Path will always be D<-C<-A. it will never be D<-C<-B<-A.

       -> Madhu
      |
      |
       -> Rakesh


              NotConnectedPerson1 -> NotConnectedPerson2



    Three ways to create Graphs
     - Edge List (some Graph class with Vertices and Edges GraphWithListOfEdges.java) ---- worst performance. do not use it.
     - Adjacency Matrix --- Good for Dense graph.
     - Adjacency List --- Good for Sparse graph. it can be represented in HashMap (e.g. BfsDfsFromGrokkingAlgorithmBook.java)

    Normally, real life graphs are Sparse. So, Adjacency List fits the best.

    Graph with Adjacency List can be represented as

        Map<Vertex, LinkedList<Vertex>> or
        Map<Vertex, Set<Vertex>> or
        Map<Vertex, Vertex[]> or  --- I am using it for this class
        Map<Vertex, BST> --- for faster search of a specific neighbour

        If you want to show weight also, then
        Map<Vertex, LinkedList<VertexWeight>>


                Tushar	Miral	Srikant	Anoop	Madhu	Rakesh	Yogita	Puja	Ronak	NotConnectedPerson1	NotConnectedPerson2
    Tushar	    1	      1	      1	      1	      1	      1
    Miral	    1	      1	      1				                   1	1
    Srikant	    1	      1	      1						                          1
    Anoop
    Madhu
    Rakesh
    Yogita		    						                            1
    Puja
    Ronak
    NotConnectedPerson1											                                                    1
    NotConnectedPerson2

    Matrix is created using 2-D array

    A[0][0] = [Tushar][Tushar]
    A[0][1] = [Tushar][Miral]
    and so on


BFs, DFS, Dijkstra's Algorithm

  Starting traversal from Vertex 'Tushar'

  BFS (Breadth First/Level First Search)
  --------------------------------------
      start BFS by initializing a QUEUE with 'Tushar' and VisitedFriends with 'Tushar' in it.
      Now, POLL 'Tushar'    (NOTE: polling dequeues the element from queue)
      Push Tushar's friends (Miral, Srikant, Anoop, Madhu, Rakesh) to queue, if they are not visited already. IMPORTANT: Visit them before pushing them in queue.

      POLL 'Miral'
      Push Miral's friends to queue, if they are not yet visited. Queue - Srikant, Anoop, Madhu, Rakesh, Puja. Visit them before pushing to queue
      (See you haven't pushed Tushar and Srikant again to queue because they are already visited)

      POLL Srikant
      and continue till queue is empty

  Visited Vertices will be in level order (all friends pushed to queue together, so visited in that order)
  [Tushar, Miral, Srikant, Anoop, Madhu, Rakesh, Puja, Ronak]

  BFS to find shortest path from Tushar to Ronak
  ----------------------------------------------
  add visited friend in visited list with its parent. So, store an object like Object(Friend, parent of Friend) in visited list.

  visited list:
    (Tushar, parent=null)
    (Miral, parent=Tushar)
    (Srikant, parent=Tushar)
    (Anoop, parent=Tushar)
    (Madhu, parent=Tushar)
    (Rakesh, parent=Tushar)
    (Puja, parent=Miral)
    (Yogita, parent=Miral)
    (Ronak, parent=Srikant)

    As soon as you find Ronak, stop there and return. you can backtrack the path from Tushar to Ronak using parents.

  BFS to find distance from Tushar to Puja
  ----------------------------------------
  you maintain a map 'Friend to distance'.
  start with distanceMap=[{Tushar, 0}]
  As you find the friends of Tushar, calculate his friends' distance by Tushar's distance+1
  Likewise,
    [
        {Tushar, 0},
        {Miral, 1},
        {Srikant, 1},
        {Anoop, 1},
        {Madhu, 1},
        {Rakesh, 1},
        {Puja, 2},
        {Ronak, 2},
    ]
   So, distance from Tushar to Puja will be 2. This is the shortest distance.

   To print the path, you need to maintain 'parent' inside Friend object and populate 'parent' as you visit the friend object.


  DFS (Depth First Search)
  ------------------------
     start BFS by initializing a STACK with 'Tushar' in it.

     Now, PEEK (not POP) 'Tushar' and visit it, if not visited already.
        Find Tushar's unvisited friend.
        If all friends are visited, then POP 'Tushar' from stack,
        otherwise PUSH ANY ONE unvisited friend to Stack (Stack=[Miral,Tushar])
        Visit pushed friend

     PEEK 'Miral' and continue above process (Stack = [Srikant, Miral, Tushar])

     PEEK 'Srikant' and continue above process (Stack = [Ronak, Srikant, Miral, Tushar])

     PEEK 'Ronak' and continue above process. As 'Ronak' doesn't have any unvisited friends, POP it from stack. (Stack = [Srikant, Miral, Tushar])

     PEEK 'Srikant' and continue above process. As 'Srikant' doesn't have any unvisited friends, POP it from stack. (Stack = [Miral, Tushar])

     PEEK 'Miral' and continue above process. (Stack = [Puja, Miral, Tushar])
     .....                                    (Stack = [Miral, Tushar])
     .....                                    (Stack = [Tushar])
     .....                                    (Stack = [Anoop, Tushar])
     .....                                    (Stack = [Tushar])
     .....                                    (Stack = [Madhu, Tushar])
     .....                                    (Stack = [Tushar])
     .....                                    (Stack = [Rakesh, Tushar])
     .....                                    (Stack = [Tushar])
     .....                                    (Stack = [])

     Visited Vertices will in 'one friend vertex at a time' order. One friend at a time will be pushed to stack.
     [Tushar, Miral, Srikant, Ronak, Puja, Anoop, Madhu, Rakesh]

     Friends in Topological Order: [Ronak, Srikant, Puja, Miral, Anoop, Madhu, Rakesh, Tushar]
     There can be many possibilities of topological order based on which unvisited friend is pushed to stack first.

     Important:
     order of popping the elements from the stack is same as topological order.
     If you want to detect a cycle, when you get neighbours of a vertex, if anyone of them is already visited, then there is a cycle. (BuildOrder.java of Cracking Coding Interview book has this requirement)
